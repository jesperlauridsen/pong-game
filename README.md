# pong-game
A simple pong game

# start
This works just by starting the index.html file in a browser. 

# faces
You can change the images by uploading new ones in ballImages folder, and then adding the names in the ballArray.js file, in the faces variable, which is used by pong.js to get a random image for the ball. Horrible, I know, but I was short on time.

# rockets
rockets are disabled for now, since for some reason they now take up like _ALL_ your machine power.

# background
The 2 images in the backgroundImages are used to make thenice background fades. Depending on how good your machine is, you might wanna disable the movement animations in the styles.css, since they also take up some power. The just rotate the colors of the field, giving it a nice vibrant look.
